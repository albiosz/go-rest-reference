## 📜 History of the Project
Initially, this project was conceived as an assistant application for the board game Honeycombs. After some time, I made the decision to transition the project to Java with Spring Framework. This pivot was motivated by Java's more mature and standardized ecosystem.

The project's successor can be found here: [honeycombs](https://github.com/albiosz/honeycombs)
